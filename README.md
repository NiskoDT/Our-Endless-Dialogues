## 📝 Description

Welcome to the project that aims to implement _chatbot_-like inside the After Story Mods, by utilizing already availble methods. Currently aiming for Monika After Story, Just Natsuki, Just Yuri, and Forever and Ever.

> [!NOTE]
> Certain ASM (After Story Mods) version may be indeed inactive or stopped developing, as of that we are looking for the most players that are using the concurrent ASM's. Please look at [Supported ASM](https://github.com/NiskoDT/Our-Endless-Dialogues/tree/md-devs?tab=readme-ov-file#-live) for this.

Right now, dialogues inside the game are very much limited, as it is manually created and not themself are talking, which causes the contents to be dried up fast. Now of course submods exist already, but then you would also have read every single dialogue of that submod.

This mod is inspired and a rewritten from the original submod [MonikA.I](https://github.com/Rubiksman78/MonikA.I) by the original author, [Rubiksman78](https://github.com/Rubiksman78). The mod aims to continue the development based of the previous submod.

As for the README, only a brief description is provided here.
